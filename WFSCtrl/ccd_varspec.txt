Variable set for CCD control:


Name         Type      Mode   Description

CCDnNAME     Char       ro     CCD name for GUI interaction

CCDnDX       Int        ro     CCD dimension X (no. of pixels)

CCDnDY       Int        ro     CCD dimension Y (no. of pixels)

CCDnXBINS    Int(array) ro     Available binnings along the X direction

CCDnYBINS    Int(array) ro     Available binnings along the Y direction
                               This two arrays are to be considered a single array of couples: (1,1) (2,2) etc.
                               If asymmetric binnings like (1,2) and (2,1) are allowed, all possible combinations
                               must be specified as separate array elements.
                              
CCDnSPEEDS   Int(array) ro     Available readout speeds

CCDnXBIN     Int        rw     Sets the X binning.

CCDnYBIN     Int        rw     Sets the Y binning. Only an (X,Y) combination found in CCDnXBINS and CCDnYBINS can be used

CCDnSPEED    Int        rw     Sets the readout speed. Together with the binning, determines the resulting frame rate.
                                                           
CCDnSTATUS   Bitwise    ro     Status word. The following bits are defined:

                               bit mask   meaning
                             
                               0x0001     Ready (the CCD is ready for operation)
                               0x0002     Operating (the CCD is acquiring frames)
                               0x0004     Error (see message in CCDnERRMSG)
                             
CCDnGO       Int        rw     Start/Stop control. Set to 1 to start operation, 0 to stop

CCDnERRMSG   Char       ro     Last error message (valid when the error bit in the status word is on).

CCDnTEMPS    Int(array) ro     CCD temperatures in Celsius degrees. The length of the array is determined by the actual # of temperature sensors.
