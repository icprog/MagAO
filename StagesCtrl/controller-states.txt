iDrive control states

This is the list of the possible iDrive control states. At launch, the control program goes through each stage from 0 to 4 in sequence. Errors in controlling the drive can put back the program to a different state from which it will try to recover.

0: Unitialized  (program starting up, iDrive communication not attempted yet)
1: power on OK  (communication test OK)
2: configured   (iDrive parameters have been configured)
3: homing       (homing started)
4: ready        (ready to accept commands)
5: moving       (executing command, goes back to 4 when done)

6: limit error  (limit switch on. goes back to 4 when fixed)
7: generic error (unable to recover from error. Check error message)

Network or power failure will put the controller back to state 0.
